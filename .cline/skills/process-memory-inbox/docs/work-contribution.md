# Processing Work Contributions and Achievements

**When to use**: Project accomplishments, performance highlights, career milestones, work achievements, or basic work log

## Storage Location
- `personal-memory/work-contribution/overview.md` - For smaller achievements and when starting
- `personal-memory/work-contribution/[project-name].md` - For major projects
- `personal-memory/work-contribution/[YYYY-QQ]-contributions.md` - For quarterly summaries

## How to Process

1. **Read the inbox entry** to identify:
   - What was accomplished?
   - What was the impact?
   - What technologies/skills were used?
   - Is this a major project or a smaller achievement?

2. **Decide the destination**:
   - **overview.md**: Smaller achievements, quick updates, or when just starting
   - **Separate file**: Major projects with significant contributions
   - **Quarterly file**: Regular updates grouped by time period

3. **Follow the template format**:

```markdown

## When to Create Separate Files

Create a new file (`project-name.md`) when:
- Major projects with significant contributions (2+ weeks of work)
- Complex initiatives that warrant detailed documentation
- Projects you'll reference frequently for portfolio/resume

Create quarterly files (`2026-q1-contributions.md`) when:
- You want to group multiple smaller achievements by time period
- Preparing for performance reviews
- Building a timeline of contributions

## Tips
- Link to related work bookmarks if applicable
- Include measurable metrics when available
- Keep descriptions concise but comprehensive
- Update the "Last Updated" date when adding new contributions
- Consider organizing by project, time period, or impact area
