# Updating the Memory Index

**When to update**: After creating new files or folders during inbox processing

## Why Update the Index?

The `personal-memory-index.md` serves as a complete map of your memory system. It must be kept current to:
- Help find information quickly
- Understand the organizational structure
- Maintain an accurate overview

## How to Update the Index

**CRITICAL**: When you create new files or folders during inbox processing:

1. **Read the entire `personal-memory-index.md` file** to understand its complete structure
2. **Make ALL appropriate changes** to keep the index accurate and up-to-date
3. **Review thoroughly** to ensure nothing was missed

The index contains two main data sections:
- **Directory Structure**: The tree view of folders and files
- **Content Overview**: Descriptions of what each folder contains

The index contains multiple sections that work together to provide a complete picture of your memory system. By reading the full file first, you'll understand what needs to be updated to maintain accuracy.

## When to Update

Update the index when you:
- ✅ Create a new file
- ✅ Create a new folder
- ✅ Reorganize files (moving/renaming)
- ✅ Delete files or folders

Don't update if you're only:
- ❌ Adding content to existing files (no structural changes)
- ❌ Updating file metadata
- ❌ Archiving processed items

**Remember**: The index is your navigation hub. Always read it thoroughly first, then update everything that needs to change to keep it accurate and complete.
